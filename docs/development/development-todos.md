# Frontend TODOs

This document outlines all identified issues, improvements, and tasks for the AI Interview Frontend codebase.

## üî• Critical/Production Issues

### Console.log Cleanup (URGENT)

**Priority: HIGH** - These should be removed or conditionalized before production deployment.

- **Home.tsx**: 4 console.log statements for debugging pagination and API responses
- **Interview.tsx**: 6 console.log statements for session management and API calls
- **EvaluationResult.tsx**: 3 console.log statements for evaluation data processing
- **api.ts**: 8 console.log statements for API request/response debugging
- **mockApi.ts**: 5 console.log statements for mock data debugging
- **Other components**: Additional console.log statements scattered throughout

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Replace console.log with proper logging service or environment-conditional logging
- [ ] Create logging utility that respects production/development environment
- [ ] Remove all debug console.log statements from production builds

### Error Handling Gaps (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Priority: HIGH** - Missing try/catch blocks and error boundaries.

- **API Calls**: 15+ API calls missing proper error handling
- **User Input Validation**: Insufficient input validation and error feedback
- **Network Error Recovery**: Missing retry logic and graceful degradation
- **Component Error Boundaries**: No error boundaries implemented

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Add comprehensive try/catch blocks to all API calls
- [ ] Implement error boundaries for component-level error handling
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- [ ] Implement retry logic for network failures
